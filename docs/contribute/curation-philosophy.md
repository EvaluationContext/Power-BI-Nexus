# Curation Philosophy

Power BI Nexus is **not** a collection of all possible resources. We curate **pointers to the best external content** that:

- Remain current and accurate
- Fill unique knowledge gaps  
- Come from authoritative sources
- Provide genuine educational value

**We prioritize quality over quantity.** Not every suggestion will be accepted, and that's by design to maintain value for the community.

## Content Inclusion Criteria

- **Resources** from authoritative sources (Microsoft, established experts)
- **Best practices** backed by official documentation or community experts
- **Active content** updated within the last 12 months (unless foundational)
- **Unique perspectives** that fill gaps in existing resources
- **Quality educational content** that helps the community

### :octicons-x-circle-fill-16: We Don't Include

- Pure promotional content without educational value
- Duplicate coverage of well-covered topics
- Outdated or inactive resources
- Low-quality or inaccurate information
- Self-promotion without demonstrated expertise
- Opinions without authoritative backing

## Disclosure Requirements

When suggesting content, always disclose your relationship:

:simple-codesandbox: "I am the author"
:simple-codesandbox: "I work for this company"
:simple-codesandbox: "I'm a user/fan of this content"
:simple-codesandbox: "No relationship"

**We evaluate based on merit.** Quality content from authors is welcome!
