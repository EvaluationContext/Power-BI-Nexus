# Security Best Practices

## Row and Object Level Security

- Apply [**Row-Level Security (RLS)**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/security/service-admin-row-level-security) if there is requirement to limit rows to particular users

- Use [**Object-Level Security (OLS)**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/security/service-admin-object-level-security?tabs=table) for highly sensitive tables/columns

## Classification and Access Control

- Apply [Sensitivity labels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/enterprise/powerbi/service-security-sensitivity-label-overview) to classify and label workspaces/datasets

- Apply **least privilege** for access to workspace and items
