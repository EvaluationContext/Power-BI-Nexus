# Contributing to Power BI Nexus

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Power BI Nexus! This project aims to be a curated, community-maintained hub for Power BI knowledge that evolves with the ecosystem.

Power BI Nexus is **not** a collection of all possible resources. We curate and maintain **pointers to the best external resources** that:

- Remain current and accurate
- Fill unique knowledge gaps
- Come from authoritative sources
- Provide genuine educational value

**We prioritize quality over quantity.** Not every suggestion will be accepted, and that's by design.
